Audio Recorder for Bengali Wiktionary
===================================

bn.wiktionary.org is a wikimedia project to provide the dictionary service for Bengali words.

To add an audio file in the wiktionary page,
1. see the word
2. read it and record in ogg format
3. upload to wikipedia commons
4. link in the same page for the audio file.

Doing these will be a boring task to do them all manually.

Think of a system, 
which shows you a word, 
you spell it.
it records it as ogg.
uploads to commons
links it to the wiktionary page.

Your only task is to spell it.


We can do this system using python.

Here is the small application which does the above said.

see in action.
